    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a functional and user-friendly app, including its contents, and the services offered.</p>
    <p>Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.</p>
    <p>The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.</p>
    <p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
    <p>I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>II. The rights of users and data subjects<br>III. Information about the data processing</p>
    <h3>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h3>
    <p>The party responsible for this app (the "controller") for purposes of data protection law is:</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Technik ohne Grenzen e.V.</span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Richard-Strauß-Straße 38</span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">91315 Höchstadt</span><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Germany</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Email: datenschutz@teog.de</span></p>
    <h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>
    <p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
    <ul type="disc">
    <li>to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to correct or complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to the immediate deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;</li>
    <li>to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);</li>
    <li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about these recipients.</p>
    <p><strong>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object to the controller&apos;s future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of direct advertising is permissible.</strong></p>
    <h3>III. Information about the data processing</h3>
    <p>Your data processed when using our app will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any statutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.</p>

    <h4>Server data</h4>
    <p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your Android device to us or to our server provider will be collected, especially to ensure a secure and stable app experience: These server log files record the method and time the app running on your Android device accesses our server interface as well as the IP address of your device.</p>
    <p>The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.</p>
    <p>The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security of our app.</p>
    <p>The data will also be stored in log files on the server of our hosting provider <i>WebNet Service</i>. Apart from this technical necessity, none of your data will be shared with third parties.</p>

    <h4>Customer account/registration</h4>
    <p>If you create a customer account with us via email or our website, we will use the data you entered during registration (your name and your email address) exclusively for providing you permanent access to the app content. We also store your IP address and the date and time of your registration. This data will not be transferred to third parties.</p>
    <p>During the registration process, your consent will be obtained for this processing of your data, with reference made to this privacy policy. The data collected by us will be used exclusively to provide your customer account.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you give your consent to this processing, Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR is the legal basis for this processing.</p>
    <p>If the opening of the customer account is also intended to lead to the initiation of a contractual relationship with us or to fulfill an existing contract with us, the legal basis for this processing is also Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
    <p>You may revoke your prior consent to the processing of your personal data at any time under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.</p>
    <p>The data previously collected will then be deleted as soon as processing is no longer necessary. However, we must observe any retention periods required under tax and commercial law.</p>

    <h4>Contact</h4>
    <p>If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we will not be able to answer it in full or at all.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.</p>
    <p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>

    <h4>User posts, comments, and ratings</h4>
    <p>Our app offers you the opportunity to post work reports. If you make use of this opportunity, we will process and publish your report, the date and time you submitted it, and your name.</p>
    <p>The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) GDPR. You may revoke your prior consent under Art. 7 Para. 3 GDPR with future effect. All you have to do is inform us that you are revoking your consent.</p>
    <p>In addition, we will also process your IP address. The IP address is processed because we might have a legitimate interest in taking or supporting further action if your report infringes the rights of third parties and/or is otherwise unlawful.</p>
    <p>In this case, the legal basis is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate interest lies in any legal defense we may have to mount.</p>
